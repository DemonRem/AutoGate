  you disengage the parking brake and/or start your engines.

* This plugin works with any plane that has a "boarding door location" entered
  on the Standard->Viewpoint screen in Plane-Maker.
* Docking guidance systems will display Airbus and Boeing model numbers if the
  correct "ICAO code" has been entered on the Standard->Viewpoint screen.
